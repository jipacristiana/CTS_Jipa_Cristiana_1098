To develop an online game (with superheroes) implement a software solution that allows:

//factory
1. Create different weapon types in the game
- currently there are 3 types of weapons PISTOL, MACHINE_GUN and ROCKET
- there is a risk that in the future new types will appear or the existing ones will change

//adapter
2. The use of an external library that contains Disney characters.
- currently the game contains its own characters that are part of the ACME framework
