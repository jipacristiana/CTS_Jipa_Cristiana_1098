This is the code review for the Account.java:
- reformatting the code for an easier reading at first sight before applying other methods (eliminate the random spaces, add spaces when it's needed, eliminate some braces etc.)
- adding an enum for replacing the static variables
- renaming some nonspecific variables and replacing some parts of the code for better understanding
- removing 2 redundant variables ('vb' and 'temp') which were unused and provoke unwanted warnings
