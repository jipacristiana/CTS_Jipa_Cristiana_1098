Description of the problem:
    In order to safeguard the account, we need a proxy that can provide a more 
    secure login system by restricting access to the check email and password method

    - very good security
    - the proxy will handle the actual object's reference

Disadvantages:
    - bottleneck
    - inappropriate change of response
    - obstruction in the identification of overload
