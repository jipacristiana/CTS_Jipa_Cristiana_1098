Bachelor topic title:
    Application for managing reservations of a dance studio

Description of the problem:
    The solution will allow clients to create multiple bookings without knowing what's behind the process.
    In order to make a booking the client must  provide his or her name, the instructor's name, and the date 
    of the dancing lesson, but the customer may also select whether they want a private dance session
    and a particular dance studio from different towns.

Advantages:
    - existing classes (client and vendor) are not updated for reuse
    - only a middle layer is applied
    - it's easy to defined adapters for any context

Disadvantages:
    - multiple inheritance may be required
