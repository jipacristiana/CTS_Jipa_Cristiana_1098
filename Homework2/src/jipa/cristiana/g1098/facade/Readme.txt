Bachelor topic title:
    Application for managing reservations of a dance studio

Description of the problem:
    We need a simple approach to test all project implementations.

Advantages:
    - an intermediary layer is provided for simpler and faster method management
    - the common interface hides calls to other interfaces
    - reduce the frequency with which you call the same class

Disadvantages:
    - raises the number of wrapper classes
    - raises the complexity of the code by hiding some methods
    - may have a negative impact on the performance of the application
