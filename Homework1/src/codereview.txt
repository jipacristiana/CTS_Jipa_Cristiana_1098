This is the code review for the Account.java:
- reformatting the code for an easier reading at first sight before applying other methods (eliminate the random spaces, add spaces when it's needed, eliminate some braces etc.)
- adding an enum for replacing the static variables
- renaming some nonspecific variables and replacing some parts of the code for better understanding (camelCase and snake_case)
- removing 2 redundant variables ('vb' and 'temp') which were unused and provoke unwanted warnings
- removing 2 redundant else cases
- removing magic numbers (.0125 and 365) with the comment and replacing them with static variables
- applying the SOLID Single Responsibility Principle
   -> outsource the total fee for year computation 
   -> outsource the loan fee computation
   -> outsource the annual loan rate computation
   -> splitting the get functions that also printed some sentences
- applying the SOLID Dependency Inversion Principle part 1
   -> make an interface for the rate methods
   -> implement the methods from the interface for the new class 'Rate'
 - applying the SOLID Dependency Inversion Principle part 2
   -> use a class reference to access that info from Account class
