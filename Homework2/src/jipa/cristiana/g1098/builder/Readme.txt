Bachelor topic title:
    Application for managing reservations of a dance studio

Description of the problem:
    The solution will allow clients to create multiple bookings without knowing what's behind the process.
    In order to make a booking the client must  provide his or her name, the instructor's name, and the date 
    of the dancing lesson, but the customer may also select whether they want a private dance session
    and a particular dance studio from different towns.

Advantages:
    - complex object can be created independent of their components
    - users may pick which components to include in their objects, giving them more freedom.
    - a single common interface is used to build all objects.

Disadvantages:
    - the solution demands the duplication of code.
    - when building an object, it's easy to overlook attributes.
    - loss of static analysis
